Dijets Network Runner and Simulator for testing network and nodes before deploying.

## Dijets NetSims SDK

NetSims-SDK allows developers to define, create, and interact with a network of Dijets nodes. Devs and system integrators can run networks of Dijets nodes with support for custom nodes, ECCs, and network configurations. With NetSims, developers can easily test code locally before deploying to public testnets like Lothar Testnet or Mainnet.
